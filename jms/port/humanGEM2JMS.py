# # Porting genome scale metabolic models for metabolomics
# 
# **Human-GEM as default human model, for better compatibility**
# https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/Human-GEM
# 
# **Use cobra to parse SBML models whereas applicable**
# 
# Not all models comply with the formats in cobra. Models from USCD and Thiele labs should comply.
# 
# **Base our code on metDataModel**
# 
# Each model needs a list of Reactions, list of Pathways, and a list of Compounds.
# It's important to include with Compounds with all linked identifiers to other DBs (HMDB, PubChem, etc), and with formulae (usually charged form in these models) when available.
# We can alwasy update the data later. E.g. the neural formulae can be inferred from charged formula or retrieved from public metabolite database (e.g., HMDB) if linked.
# Save in Python pickle and in JSON.
# 
# **No compartmentalization**
# - After decompartmentalization,
#   - transport reactions can be removed - they are identified by reactants and products being the same.
#   - redundant reactions can be merge - same reactions in diff compartments become one.
